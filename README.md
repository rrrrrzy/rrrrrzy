- 🏳️‍🌈 I thought I could fly, so why did I drawn ?

```
I don't know where I'm at
I'm standing out the back
And I'm tired of waiting

Waiting here in line
Hoping that I'll find
What I've been chasing

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
You never know why
It's coming down, down, down

I'm not ready to let go
'Cause then I'll never know
What I could be missing
But I'm missing way too much
So when do I give up
What I've been wishing for?

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
I'll never know why
It's coming down, down, down

Oh, I am coming down, down, down
I can't find another way around
And I don't wanna hear the sound
Of losing what I've never found

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown?
I'll never know why
It's coming down, down, down

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try?
I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown? Oh
It's coming down, down, down
